# simple-input-with-floating-placeholder
Example of simple input with floating placeholder base on material design idea.

**What I used?:**
* HTML5
* CSS3 
* one line of JS :)
* Font Awesome Icons

**Why I created it?**

I would like to present how simple is to create a tricky input with floating placeholder only in HTML5 and CSS3 without external libraries.

**Why is tricky?**
1. You have a floating placeholder (like material design one).
2. You can simple change the size of it, just by setting font size on main element <html>, because the whole input sizes are "rem" based.
3. You can change the icon as you want, just by modyfied the Font Awesome icon code.
4. You can change the validation colors, only in css (no more changes are needed).
